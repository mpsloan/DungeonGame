# DungeonGame
This program is an implemenatation of an object oriented dungeon game. The program creates a player object and uses many different methods 
throughout the player class, and the DungeonEscape class to utilize different attributes and moves for both the main player and the monsters. 
The player starts out in the norhtwest corner and the goal is to reach the southeast corner alive to escape while various monsters spawn 
throughout the rooms and the player may have to fight them to get to the end. I added an additional object titled gold, and the gold is placed 
in random various rooms and the console notifies the player if they have picked up gold in a room, and keeps track of the total gold count.
